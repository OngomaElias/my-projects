## üò•üíî 1.Titanic Story

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. 
 On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, 
the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. 
This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not
 enough lifeboats for the passengers
 and crew.
 Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking,
 some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, 
and the upper-class passengers.

My objective for this project will be to build a regression model That predicts ticket price(Fare).üöÄ

## ‚úç 2.Business understanding
In Elias_Ongoma_Individual_project_Wk8, My objective is to 
Train a machine learning model to predict the product category based on the other features.

## ‚úç 3.Using The European Central Bank API
In this project (Elias_ongoma_Indiv_Guided_WK6), I will connect to the Frankfurter APIprovided be the European 
Central Bank on current and historical_ foreign exchanges rates. 

* I will perform  a  simple  summary  statistic  and	present  any	interesting conclusion you can draw
* I will use mainly visualization with minimal computations.
* I will	usse in built methods like sum(),std(), etc.

### üìùObjectives
I will determine how the exchange rate of the Euro (EUR) against the US Dollar (USD) changed over time,
presenting my outcome with a line chart showing the exchange rate for EUR to
USD

* I will determine the distribution of exchange rates for the Chinese Yuan (CNY) against the Euro (EUR)?

* I will determine The more volatile of the currencies	between the Great British Pound (GBP) and the Japanese Yen (JPY) 
using a Bar chart to compare the volatility of the selected currencies.

* I will determine if there is a correlation between the exchange rates of the Canadian Dollar (CAD) and the
 American Dollar (USO),using a Scatter plot with CAD to USO and data points representing the exchange rates.
